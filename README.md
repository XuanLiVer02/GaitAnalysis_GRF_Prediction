# GaitAnalysis_GRF_Prediction
Leveraging high-density insole data to make predictions on Ground Reaction Force/Ground Reaction Moment (GRF/GRM) with deep learning models.  
Using Important features: Center of Pressure, Peak Pressure, Contact Area, Pressure-Time Integral  
Trying Wavelet Neural Network, Convolutional Networks, Transformer-based models, etc.  
Here is a short list of the methods have been implemented so far:  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 1-6: Data Preprocessing, WNN with different inputs  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 7-8: CNN, or variants with LSTM  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 9-10: GCN  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 11: DeformConv Network  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 12: Transformers, or with CNN-based encoders (for transfer learning)  
&emsp;&emsp;Week 13 - Present: Adding COP as important features, more physically-restricted, Visualization
